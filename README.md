# BetNews

## The project
BetNews is an application created in 2 weeks by 4 students of Le Wagon, Nantes. This is the final project after 9 weeks of an intensive bootcamp.
BetsNews targets young people (18-30 years old) who are not really interested in traditional media and want to learn and follow the news while having fun.
With betNews, you can bet on the news with betcoins (after studying the odds), you can create your own bet and you can challenge your friends to the leaderboard.
The vocation of Betnews is to provide a fun way for young people to learn about current events. They can choose a category (Economy, Politic, Planet, Entertainment, Culture, Sport,...). They can click on each "Bet card" to read more information about the context of the event and to find additionnal links to medias to learn more before betting.
All the bets are published by users. Anyone can publish a bet.

## Web skills
BetNews is a rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates).
We used Ruby on Rails framework and Ruby, HTML, CSS & Javascript languages. 
This app was also created using Bootstrap, Cloudinary, Heroku & Figma for the wireframe.

## Next Steps
The team plans to keep working on this application after the bootcamp.
We would like to add the following features :
- As a publisher, you can edit his bet
- As a publisher, you can delete his bet
- As a publisher, you can know how many people answer to his published bet
- As a publisher, you can receive a notification on his phone or an email as a reminder when he has to publish the result of his published bet
- As a user, you can add a profile picture.
- As user, you can create or join a league to play only with your friends
